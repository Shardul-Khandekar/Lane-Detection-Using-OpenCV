# Lane-Detection-Using-OpenCV
This includes a basic implementation of lane detection using various filters from OpenCV.
Initially the video is converted to gray scale image to reduce the number of computations.
GaussianBlur and Canny edge detection is used.
Then corresponding line co-ordinates are obtained and a line is drawn to indicate the lane
